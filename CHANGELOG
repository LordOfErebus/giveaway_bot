v1.0.2
-Made it so the !collected command doesn't fail if there was no number to indicate how many of an item was being donated.

v1.0.1
-!donation and !top now uses embeds for better visual appearance. Staff commands have been separated to their own embed and are only visible to those with the correct role.
-Multiple restrictions on donations must be separated by commas instead of pipe characters now.
-Testing for prime items now uses heavy regex. Number checking changed to include front and back, and x letters.
-Title case enforced on all item names (affects x2 and such because the x is in front).
-Changed the maximum row value from 999 to unspecified to prevent a future problem.
-Removed anonymous tracking sheet updating because it's obsolete.
-Changed the filler values for restrictions and notes from blanks to N/A to accommodate the new embed usage.
