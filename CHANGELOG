v2.0.1
-!wonby now fills in TRUE for the Started and Ended columns on the spreadsheet.

v2.0.0
-Reworked the bot under the functional programming paradigm. Most operations are now executed in an assembly line format to get the final result. Intermediate values are no longer mutated from the original.
-File structure changed to isolate scripts to src.
-Custom timer system scrapped in favor of Cron Jobs (npm cron package). Minimum time set at 5 minutes to prevent problems with the technical limitations of the package (because it resolves a little slower, it can cause the time to load into the past instead).
-NoSQL storage system Node Persist has been removed in favor of SQLite3. Bindings are made via the Sequelize library.
-Consolidated all settings into a single function.
-Added a configuration file for more generalized behaviour changes. Added environmental configurations.
-Permissions system now uses bit flags.
-Documentation in standard JSDoc form has been added to files.

v1.0.2
-Made it so the !collected command doesn't fail if there was no number to indicate how many of an item was being donated.

v1.0.1
-!donation and !top now uses embeds for better visual appearance. Staff commands have been separated to their own embed and are only visible to those with the correct role.
-Multiple restrictions on donations must be separated by commas instead of pipe characters now.
-Testing for prime items now uses heavy regex. Number checking changed to include front and back, and x letters.
-Title case enforced on all item names (affects x2 and such because the x is in front).
-Changed the maximum row value from 999 to unspecified to prevent a future problem.
-Removed anonymous tracking sheet updating because it's obsolete.
-Changed the filler values for restrictions and notes from blanks to N/A to accommodate the new embed usage.
