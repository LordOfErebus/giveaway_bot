-File structure changed to isolate scripts to src.
-Custom timer system scrapped in favor of Cron Jobs (npm cron package). Minimum time set at 5 minutes to prevent problems with the technical limitations of the package (because it resolves a little slower, it can cause the time to load into the past instead).

-Removed anonymous tracking sheet updating because it's obsolete.
-Changed the filler values for restrictions and notes from blanks to N/A to accommodate the new embed usage.
